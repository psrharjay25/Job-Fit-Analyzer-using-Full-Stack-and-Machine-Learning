# Personality Prediction using Machine Learning and Deep Learning

The fundamental objective of our project is to provide an efficient screening system for the companies to recruit manpower resources. Our model will help the companies to sort their job applicants based on an analysis of scores of psychometric tests and questionnaires. Our main objectives are:
1.	To help the job recruiters to categorise their candidates based on tests, questionnaires and resume
2.	To make it effortless for an organisation to fasten their enlistment process
3.	To assist them with picking the most reasonable up-and-comer in less time
4.	To provide a software/model for job seekers to analyse their resume and build their resume in accordance with the requirements
